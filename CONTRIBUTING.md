def calculate_damage(self, attacker, defender):
    """
    Calculate damage between attacker and defender.
    
    Args:
        attacker (dict): Unit performing the attack
        defender (dict): Unit receiving the attack
        
    Returns:
        tuple: (damage_amount, is_critical_hit)
    """
    base_damage = attacker["attack"] - defender["defense"]
    is_crit = random.randint(1, 100) <= attacker["crit_rate"]
    
    if is_crit:
        damage = int(base_damage * (attacker["crit_damage"] / 100))
    else:
        damage = base_damage
        
    return max(1, damage), is_crit
```

### üé® Content Contributions

#### New Horror Entities
When suggesting new entities, provide:
- **Name**: Entity name
- **Origin**: Source material (Creepypasta, SCP, etc.)
- **Rarity**: Common/Rare/Epic/Legendary
- **Base Stats**: HP, Attack, Defense, Speed
- **Skill**: Description of special ability
- **Passive**: Ongoing effect description
- **Lore**: Brief background description

#### Example Entity Submission:
```python
{
    "name": "The Backrooms Entity",
    "rarity": "Epic",
    "hp": 120,
    "attack": 18,
    "defense": 8,
    "speed": 22,
    "skill": "reality_shift",
    "crit_rate": 10,
    "crit_damage": 175,
    "accuracy": 90,
    "evasion": 15,
    "passive": "Phase Walk: 25% chance to avoid all damage",
    "description": "A mysterious entity that stalks the endless yellow rooms."
}
```

## üìã Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
